### Cryptic

Cryptic is an API that allows you to request a POST method to localhost:8080/encrypter or localhost:8080/decrypter 
which will give you an encrypting message based on your input. Since the API is not actually hosted anywhere.

You'll have to use cd (Change Directory) into the project root and perform <mvn spring-boot:run> on your command line.
